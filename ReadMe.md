# Personal Website  ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my web portfolio website. This website isn't just my new portfolio, but also a personal project in and of itself. I think I've grown quite a bit as a developer in the past year, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of what I've learned and done.

## What I used
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) my ride-or-die
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for easy push-to-deploy hosting
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for less time-consuming and more modular CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms//) for a quick email form layout
- [Iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) for stocked icons
- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for a simple, sans-PHP contact form

Let me know what you think!
